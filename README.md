scripts to reproduce the analysis and figures from Bai et al., 2015

This folder contains all scripts necessary to reproduce the results 
obtained from the 16S rRNA profiling of natural communities and isolated
bacterial cultures presented in Bai et al., 2015. It consists of the
following steps:

1. Independent procesing from the different 16S rRNA datasets:

    - current study analysis of root natural communities
    - current study profiling of leaf natural communities
    - Bulgarelli et al., 2012 and Schaeppi et al., 2014 16S datasets (root)
    - Horton et al., 2014 dataset (leaf)
    - profiling of isolated baceterial cultures (root & leaf).

2. Calculation of recovery rates of the root and leaf core culture
collections (At-RSPHERE and At-LSPHERE) with respect to the current
study amplicon profiling as well previous studies.

NOTE:

The raw data (from the sequencing machine) necessary to run these scripts, as 
well as mapping file, metadata and intermediate results can be downloaded from:
